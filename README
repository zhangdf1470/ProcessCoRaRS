check the trigger rate of tge detector:
fit the distribution of Event.dt, the slope is the rate.

-----------------Setup enviroment---------------------
1. tar -zxvf Rootcore.tar.gz
2. navigate to Rootcore/
3. ./configure
4. get out of Rootcore/: cd ../Rootcore/
5. setup enviroment: . Rootcore/script/setup.sh
6. compile the package: ./Rootcore/script/build.sh


The process of analysing ED consists of nine stages:
Stage 1: Select the branches we will use (Read configuration file: ./Config/rawdata);

Stage 2: Calculate hitting point on TGC and Scintillation ;
Stage 3: Get pedestal deift (export file: ./Config/pedestaldrift);

Stage 4: Get the calibration of scintillators (Read configuration file: ./Config/simutimeconfig);
Stage 5: Simulate the relationship between calibration and distance from hit point to PMT by a poly5 function;
Stage 6: Get the new calibretion using the results from Stage 3&4 ;

Stage 7: Calculate all the variables that we will use in next stages and name them by the characterics we can understand ;
Stage 8: Correct the time difference between measured time and reconstructed time ;
Stage 9: Fill histograms and get the results by fitting or other methods, finallu output PDF files ;

How to run the program:
1: . setting.sh # setup root and export some global varibales
  setup root and RootCore enviroment
  alias compilepackages to "./RootCore/script/build.sh" #compile packages in working directory
2: compilepackages
3: make clean
4: make
5: ./main.exe // it will ask which stage you want to run
